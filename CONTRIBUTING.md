## üî¨ Model Validation Requirements

### For Credit Assessment Features

All new features must include:

1. **Data Source Documentation**
   - Dataset origin and collection method
   - Data quality assessment
   - Fair lending compliance check

2. **Statistical Significance**
   - Correlation analysis with loan approval
   - Feature importance scores
   - Impact on model performance

3. **Financial Relevance**
   - Explain lending significance
   - Describe impact on credit decisions
   - Justify inclusion criteria

### Example Feature Contribution

```python
# ‚úÖ GOOD: Well-documented feature
def calculate_debt_to_income_ratio(applicant_income, coapplicant_income, loan_amount):
    """
    Calculate debt-to-income ratio for credit assessment.
    
    Fair Lending Compliance:
    - Does not use protected class characteristics
    - Complies with Equal Credit Opportunity Act
    - Based on verifiable financial data only
    
    Statistical Validation:
    - Correlation with approval: 0.68 (p < 0.001)
    - Feature importance: 12.3% in SVM model
    - Tested on 100,000+ loan applications
    
    Args:
        applicant_income (float): Primary applicant income
        coapplicant_income (float): Co-applicant income
        loan_amount (float): Requested loan amount
    
    Returns:
        float: Debt-to-income ratio (0.0-1.0)
    """
    # Implementation with proper validation
    pass
```
